      <description>The first thing I needed to do was define the kind of game I wanted to make within the constraints that I defined before.
 Actually the first thing I already decided beforehand was the engine that I&#39;m going to use. Obviously because this series is about getting something done I&#39;m not going to write my own one.
The game will be made in Godot, mainly because it is free, open source, easy to use and just great overall.</description>
