    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Hello again! It's been 4 weeks this time. I'd really love to get into an argument with any of you whether there is an obvious trend or not, but that'd be a very short argument since I have to admit that every post is getting done 1 week later than the previous.</p>
<p>In fact there currently is a linear increase in time such that the number of the post corresponds to the time in weeks between this and the last one. Part 2 was posted 2 weeks after part 1, part 3 was posted 3 weeks after part 2, and now I'm writing part 4 <em>exactly</em> 4 weeks after posting part 3.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that if I ever want to really get anything done I should probably try to either get rid of that trend or reduce it from weeks to days.</p>
<h2 id="what-has-happened">What has happened?</h2>
<p>Remember in the last part I wrote that I wanted to add power-ups? <em>Well, I didn't!</em></p>
<p>Remember in the last part I wrote that I wanted to re-do the assets? <em>Well, I didn't!</em></p>
<p>Remember in the last part I wrote that I don't have a clear path in mind? <em>Well, I still don't!</em></p>
<p>What I did, though, was to improve the scoring a little, making it a tad more satisfying, which in my opinion plays a big role in every Highscore-centric game. Have a look.</p>
<p><img src="/gifs/scoring_new_2.gif" alt="New Scoring"></p>
<p>I also replaced the old shields with new one, using the same fragment-shader technique to dynamically make them the fitting color.</p>
<h3 id="most-important-changes">Most important changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>The scoring is in my opinion one of the most important things. Having the score multiplier and the current score pop out with every defeated enemy is making the game <em>a game</em>.</li>
<li>I tweaked some numbers to speed up the gameplay. The default charging times are made a lot shorter. It makes it a little less boring :)</li>
<li>Also what's not instantly apparent: the charging time gets faster the higher the current multiplier is. That's written nowhere and I don't intend to tell the player either. <em>If</em> this thing stays it should build more tension when having a high multiplier makes the game <em>feel</em> faster. Also it's easier to make a mistake and lose that sweet multiplier again.</li>
<li>I had a problem indicating the current charge status to the player. The way the screen and the game is designed the player usually keeps focusing on the top of the screen or the enemies in general. No one is going to keep an eye on the laser cannon to see which charge they are currently at.
To combat this I added a &ldquo;targeting-system&rdquo;, which is basically just a smaller laser showing the current color.</li>
<li>I also started to build for Android and playtest it on my own phone on the go. On mobile there are also vibrating indicators whenever a new charge level is reached (e.g. blue to green, green to red etc.) or when an enemy is defeated. This helps further to keep attention on the enemies and makes the gameplay a little more satisfying.</li>
<li>There are <em>reactions</em> popping up on the bottom of the screen. Seen the &ldquo;Wow!&quot;, &ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; labels float around?
The intention was to add a <em>hot-streak</em> (I guess I can call it that) mechanic. When the player destroys multiple shields in quick succession a certain level of streak-bonus is reached which should award extra points. This should be further improved when or <em>if</em> I change the <em>theme</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="changing-the-theme">Changing the theme??</h3>
<p>Yeah, I don't like it. Not that I just don't like the assets (which I really don't), I also don't really like the cannon itself.
I'm thinking about maybe making it a <em>person</em> floating above a city shooting lasers out of their <em>suit which is totally not iron-man</em> and having people below cheer on the player's <em>hot-streaks</em>. That's the current idea.</p>
<p><strong>I should still remember to keep the scope small though :)</strong></p>
<h3 id="most-important-things-to-do-next">Most important things to do next(?)</h3>
<p>That's an interesting one. Because this changes <em>every</em>. <em>other</em>. <em>day</em>.
Seriously every time I sit down to continue on this project I see something else to do. This is why this will be an (incomplete) unordered list!</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor screen shake effects for shooting and destroyed ships. This might seem minor but may have a larger impact on the feel than I think. Shouldn't take too long either.</li>
<li>New theme: new background (city), cannon (floating <em>definitely-not-iron-man</em> - character), new enemy ships</li>
<li>More diverse enemy pathing. The current pathing is <strong>boooring</strong> - top to bottom. I want to have some enemies come in from the side, fly through, and come back on the other side.</li>
<li>Menu and UI. Nothing more to say here I guess..</li>
<li>[..]</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope to get some of those things done until next time. Which should probably be in&hellip; <strong>5 weeks right?</strong></p>
