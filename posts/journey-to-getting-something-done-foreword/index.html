<p>Obviously I don't struggle to get things done at work, otherwise I wouldn't have a job.<br>
It's also no problem for me to finish a box of chocolates, or binge watch an entire season of <em>Brooklyn 99</em> the day it releases on Netflix.
No, it's this very specific set of things that just refuse to get to a state which most people would call &lsquo;Done&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While I'm sure there are many people with that same level of expertise in <em>not getting things done</em> it is in no way a particularly helpful skill to have.</p>
<p>The thing is: You will never hear about people who don't get things done - well, maybe if you are <em>really</em>, <em>extraordinarily</em> good at it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I like to imagine that there have been numerous attempts to get known by <em>not gettings things done</em> but no one went through with it yet.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course you can be famous <strong>for</strong> not getting things done but only in a negative way - probably no one will tell you: &ldquo;<em>I admire you and your ability to not get things done!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have started multiple prototypes for game ideas that never made it past the &ldquo;base mechanic's working, good enough for today&rdquo; phase.
Although I feel like I want to have stuff to show I'm struggling to get that stuff to a state where it can be shown.</p>
<p>So there's my problem and I think there are multiple reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I tend to slack when theres nothing at stake. I mean, it's just a side project - it's not <em>that</em> important, right?</li>
<li>Obviously time is a big factor. There's work to be done, dishes to be cleaned, friends and family to be looked after, couches to be relaxed on, series to be binged, .. whoops, there we go. Back to Point 1 again.</li>
<li>Scope and overengineering. I feel like this is widely known but nonetheless a very important one. Let's be honest, it's <em>really</em> hard to keep a small, doable scope for hobby projects. Thinking about making a small webapp? Better check out all available frameworks, new technologies, make it reliable, modular, extendable. Want to make a tetris clone? Better make it playable on all platforms with progression and meta-progression, RPG elements, maybe some TCG mechanics. You know what would be fun? BattleRoyale Mode! (I know, Tetris BR is a thing)
Before you even started to program you are already overwhelmed. Also after coming up with all these ideas you deserve a rest on the couch and maybe watch the next episode of <em>The Witcher</em>.. whoops, back to Point 1 again.</li>
</ul>
<p>So how should I face this issue?
Well, if you think about, <em>getting something done seems like a pretty good step in the right direction</em>.</p>
<p>And that's what I'm going to do and what this post and all following (hopefully, see first sentence :)) are really about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I will create a simple game from start to finish.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point I have to admit that this is not the first time I'm saying this sentence.
Few years ago I felt exactly the same. I decided that over the summer break (I was in university still) I would create a game (with the help of my friend who created all assets) from start to finish in the given time frame and I will release it before Uni starts again, no matter what. <em>And I'm proud to say that it worked!</em>
(if you're interested you can check it out here: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=at.gousoogames.elements.android&amp;hl=en_US">&ldquo;Elements&rdquo; Play Store Link</a>)
What I'm not so proud to say is that this was the only time that it worked. Since then I haven't got anything near the finish line again.</p>
<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2>
<p>I decided that I will define some rules and constraints in a game-jamy fashion. This should help to stay in a doable scope and make it a little easier. There will be no timeframe as, still, it's a side project and burning out on finishing something isn't a very nice goal either. It should stay fun which should be possible by constraining the scope of the game, thus increasing the sense of progress, while not turning it into a second day job.</p>
<p>Here's what I'm planning to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Think of the simplest game you can imagine, try to spice it up a little, and finish it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>My Constraints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The game only consists of 3 &ldquo;Screens&rdquo;: A &ldquo;Menu&rdquo; screen, a &ldquo;Game&rdquo; screen, and a &ldquo;Game Over&rdquo; screen. Options-Screen and all the other stuff should not really be needed when considering all other constraints.</li>
<li>The game focuses to be playable on a single static platform.</li>
<li>It should only consist of a single main mechanic. The mechanic can be altered to spice it up, but it should stay the only one.</li>
<li>Assets should not take longer than, say, 5 hours to create per asset. If it doesn't look good, worry about it until after the game is &ldquo;finished&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following posts I will try to document the different stages that I am at in development, kind of like a <em>devlog</em> I guess. I hope that maintaining a series of blog posts will also increase the chances of me finishing this experiment.</p>
<p>In the rare chance that you like the idea and want to continue reading, and in the <em>not-so-rare</em> chance that the series stops somewhere in the middle, please give me a poke, send me a message and help me get back on this <strong>journey to getting something done</strong> :)</p>
