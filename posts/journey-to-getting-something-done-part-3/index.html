    <section class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>This time it's been around 3 weeks of not posting the next part. The increasingly larger interval between blog posts is not exactly hard to notice. It's also feeling a lot like I'm starting again to not getting something done.</p>
<p>I've also been sick the last 2 weeks. <em>That's a very neat little excuse for procrastinating</em>. To be fair it's a good excuse for not posting the last 2 weeks. It's no good excuse for not posting the first week.</p>
<p>Anyway here I am. And here's the current state of that thing I'm trying to get somewhat done:</p>
<p><img src="/gifs/reactive_mechanic.gif" alt="Reactive mechanic"></p>
<p>Some stuff has changed. Let me go over it real quick.</p>
<h2 id="reactive-mechanic">Reactive Mechanic</h2>
<p>I changed the main mechanic <em>again</em>. Previously the idea was to charge a series of laser attacks and make the player plan ahead. This was <em>okay</em>-ish at first. It was nice to have to keep an eye out for spaceships of different speed and plan your charges ahead. As it turns out though the old mechanic had a major downside: You get overwhelmed real quick while also having slow gameplay. This is in my opinion not optimal for a mobile game.</p>
<p>So I changed it to a more reactive method. The player now has to hold the charge button a certain amount of time to charge the different kind of laser beams. What I like about this approach is that you can use the feeling of <em>timing</em>. At first the player has to keep an eye on the visual indicators on the laser-cannon to when a certain type of beam is ready. After some practice the player gets a <em>feel</em> for the perfect timing to release the button and is able to concentrate more on the approaching enemies. So there's already a small learning curve.</p>
<h2 id="visual-indicator">Visual Indicator</h2>
<p>I have added that above mentioned visual indicator to the laser cannon to show the player which type of laser beam is currently charged.</p>
<h3 id="some-details">Some Details</h3>
<p>I kind of want to explain how I approached this. If you are like me, completely lacking any artistical skills worth mentioning, this might be a little help. It'd help me I guess.</p>
<p>The Cannon consists of 2 sprites and 1 sprite-sheet. The base of the cannon is just a single sprite. Nothing moves just yet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cannon_base.png" alt="Cannon base"></p>
<p>The cannon itself is also just a single sprite. I'm just rotating the sprite towards the nearest enemy on every tick.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cannon.png" alt="Cannon"></p>
<p>The effect is a sprite sheet which I created layered on top of the cannon. It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/cannon_fx_spritesheet.png" alt="Cannon FX"></p>
<p>The first row of the spritesheet is the charging animation. The second row is the shooting animation. The different colors of the charging animation is just a (fragment-)shader applied to the sprite in the engine. Based on the current charging level of the cannon I change the color of the black pixels to either blue, green or red. I plan to do the same on the shields of the enemies. This way I can implement powerups which change colors or even add <em>colorblind modes</em> (which really is necessary for games using colors as a main mechanic).</p>
<h2 id="enemy-balancing">Enemy &ldquo;balancing&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I added a simple enemy balancing (if I'm even allowed to call it that). Enemies with <em>harder</em> shields (e.g. reds) and <em>more</em> shields (e.g. 3 reds) are slower than <em>easier</em> enemies (e.g. 1 blue shield). That way you get the occasional quick blue ship charging in while you try to fight off the 3-red ship. This makes the gameplay a little more dynamic and helps with getting overwhelmed too quickly.</p>
<h1 id="whats-next-to-do">What's next to do</h1>
<p><em>I really don't like the assets. They're ugly. I know I'm no artist but I will try to improve on them a little more  in the next parts.</em></p>
<p>As mentioned above I want to add the same technique I used for the cannon effects to the shields of the enemy ships. More importantly though I need to add some fun mechanics to it. The reactive mechanic improves the gameplay a little, but let's be honest it's really stale.</p>
<p>There needs to be some powerups. Maybe more enemies. Increase in charging speed. Something like that.
One idea I already had was to make a powerup which makes every shield blue for the next few seconds. This makes the player just smash the charge button. Maybe even add an laser-plosion powerup which just clears the whole screen. In short: more action, more satisfaction - <em>the usual stuff!</em>.</p>
<p>Continuing on this also the combo indicator (top right corner) and score (top left corner) needs large effects. Stacking that combo up should be something satisfying.</p>
<p>As you may notice I don't have a clear path in mind currently. Maybe I'm still recovering from my sick <del>days</del> weeks.</p>
