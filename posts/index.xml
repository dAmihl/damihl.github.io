      <description>I have a strong history of successfully not getting things done. In fact theres a very specific set of things that I&#39;m not getting done: Personal stuff.
Obviously I don&#39;t struggle to get things done at work, otherwise I wouldn&#39;t have a job.
It&#39;s also no problem for me to finish a box of chocolates, or binge watch an entire season of Brooklyn 99 the day it releases on Netflix. No, it&#39;s this very specific set of things that just refuse to get to a state which most people would call &amp;lsquo;Done&amp;rsquo;.</description>
